How to Make a Difference While Networking!

A great way to get involved that you may not have considered is joining a nonprofit board.

As a young professional, volunteering is a great way to connect and collaborate with others while also making a difference. 

Growing friendships is easiest when you have a shared passion or interest. For instance, Bear Necessities Young Professional's Board, is a group of young professionals passionate about helping those with cancer. Personally, as someone who saw my sister struggle her way through cancer at 17, I connect with this mission. 

Serving others also helps keep us humble and hone our emotional intelligence. How many times have you taken the ability to walk for granted? I bet you’ll be a little more thankful after serving someone who is confined to a hospital bed.  

Volunteer boards require time and energy. Depending on what organization you get involved in, you may be asked to step out of your comfort zone or try something brand new. If you are willing to put in the effort, the benefits will often far outweigh the work. 

The first step is identifying what kind of an organization best fits you. Would you like to be involved with a charity dealing with homelessness, healthcare, arts, education, disability rights, or environment affairs? The choices are numerous. Which is why we compiled a list of young professional associate boards below. Please take a look below and consider spending your free time helping with a worthy cause!
